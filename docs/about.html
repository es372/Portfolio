                Hello my name is Ethan Singh, and I am new to the User Experience and User Interface design field. Right now my focus is to
                acquire quality experience so I can be a more than capable professional. I’ve found that I enjoy developing products and/or
                services to solve a problem or achieve a goal. Through out high school, I studied Science Technology Engineering and Math (STEM).
                I have experience working in multiple industries carrying out responsibilities involving; customer service, logistics, and
                management. I am currently  attending college for Computer Science in Human Computer Interaction at New Jersey Institute of
                Technology (NJIT). I have been working on projects separate from my schooling, to learn more about UI design as well as become a
                better designer.
            </p>
            <p>
                One thing I love, is perspective. Life can never be boring when trying to fully understand another person. Perspective allows me
                to better assist others, and it allows me to give more as well. I am glad that I’ve come across UX/UI design because it is an
                activity that involves perspective. As I am still new, I am discovering what I like about this field. With that being said, I am
                looking forward to my journey as a UX/UI designer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thank you for your time!
